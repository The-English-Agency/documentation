What sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and ate up their brains and imagination?
Moloch! Solitude! Filth! Ugliness! Ashcans and unobtainable dollars! Children screaming under the stairways! Boys sobbing in armies! Old men weeping in the parks!
Moloch! Moloch! Nightmare of Moloch! Moloch the loveless! Mental Moloch! Moloch the heavy judger of men!
Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the crossbone soulless jailhouse and Congress of sorrows! Moloch whose buildings are judgment! Moloch the vast stone of war! Moloch the stunned governments!
Moloch whose mind is pure machinery! Moloch whose blood is running money! Moloch whose fingers are ten armies! Moloch whose breast is a cannibal dynamo! Moloch whose ear is a smoking tomb!
Moloch whose eyes are a thousand blind windows! Moloch whose skyscrapers stand in the long streets like endless Jehovahs! Moloch whose factories dream and croak in the fog! Moloch whose smoke-stacks and antennae crown the cities!
Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
Moloch in whom I sit lonely! Moloch in whom I dream Angels! Crazy in Moloch! Cocksucker in Moloch! Lacklove and manless in Moloch!
Moloch who entered my soul early! Moloch in whom I am a consciousness without a body! Moloch who frightened me out of my natural ecstasy! Moloch whom I abandon! Wake up in Moloch! Light streaming out of the sky!
Moloch! Moloch! Robot apartments! invisible suburbs! skeleton treasuries! blind capitals! demonic industries! spectral nations! invincible madhouses! granite cocks! monstrous bombs!
They broke their backs lifting Moloch to Heaven! Pavements, trees, radios, tons! lifting the city to Heaven which exists and is everywhere about us!
Visions! omens! hallucinations! miracles! ecstasies! gone down the American river!
Dreams! adorations! illuminations! religions! the whole boatload of sensitive bullshit!
Breakthroughs! over the river! flips and crucifixions! gone down the flood! Highs! Epiphanies! Despairs! Ten years’ animal screams and suicides! Minds! New loves! Mad generation! down on the rocks of Time!
Real holy laughter in the river! They saw it all! the wild eyes! the holy yells! They bade farewell! They jumped off the roof! to solitude! waving! carrying flowers! Down to the river! into the street!
From “Howl” by Allen Ginsberg






A Human-Centric, Technology-Assisted Organization

Spiel 
(A rant)

The core-business for which this product is being created is human-centric. That means technology compliments the activities of the business, but the center of the business activity is human relationship and human interaction. 

Compare this with companies like Facebook, Uber, and Twitter. So-called “social” companies. In these companies, and perhaps many more, the human use of technology (and the thereby data generated) is the core user and business activity. 

Users primarily interact with the platform and the conten of users,t, as opposed to a healthy, human-esque pattern (like WhatsApp). The relation of user A producing the content with the user B consuming that content is peripheral to both user and business activities. This is an unhealthy pattern. 

The basis of the business for which this product is being created is human interaction. It values spontaneity, individuality, and authenticity. DHH, the creator of ruby on rails, in his blog, talks about the toxicity of the conventional business practices of Silicon Valley, putting Ginsberg's world eating monster, Mulloch, on hyper-drive. There are many more who hark on about dark patterns and a culture of shut-ins. You don't need to read the numerous psychology studies to realize that our technology habits are unhealthy. You just need to look up from your cell phone long enough to see that everyone, everywhere, ALL THE TIME, is staring into their screen.

The classes in my business  are different. There is no artifice whatsoever. No screens, no videos, homework, very few texts, no games. Just two people looking into each others eyes and throwing words back and forth with each other. Generating sound-waves and dancing with the ideas their minds create. A conversation is a beautiful thing.

And the more I've done this, the more I've seen the potential power in it.

For many of my students, the only real interaction they have at all is with me or their teacher. They only see their friends occasionally, less so than in the past, because of social media. Their relations with co-workers are naturally tainted with office politics and forced interaction, which is usually shallow and guarded.  Daily interaction with their romantic partners is chock full of it's own emotional charges and unrealistic expectations, including the monotony of domestic life.

There's value to sitting down with someone, outside of culturally defined relations like in the office or at home, for an hour and just shoot the breeze. In today's world, it may be something revolutionary! I am a huge techno-phile, and see the benefits of using technology to improve processes and outcomes, but I don't want to get sucked into Silicon-Valley startup business practices. Growth is good, sure, and I want to use technology to help the business grow, but I don't want to sacrifice the something beautiful I've managed to create. 

So, back to the subject, what does a product for a human-centric business look like?

Each letter represents a user permissions group. The number of actual views, or permissions, contained within a particular group is perhaps more, perhaps less, than the total number of groups. (A note: It  is recommended that these groupings and the app contents( features, views, and permissions) be explored and late expressed, using visualizations and computations and reasoning techniques related to modern set theory (A note on the note: why modern, I don't know! Is there a difference?).

Further Considerations about Features

A. Growth-Hacking
1. accounting record keeping: 
Reduce paperwork. Reduce need for Administration. Reduce operations costs. Reduce errors.

2. payment processing
See above. Also facilitate student's access and continued financial engagement. Improve predictability. Provide flexible payment options. Installment plans. Pay anywhere (on-the-go). Scheduled payments. Credit-based usage system. (later: Marketplace pricing.)
Most English schools are loaded down with schedules, payments, and loads of other paperwork.  Size per outfit is limited in conventional models. Let's automate away all that boring shit.

B. Branding
3. quality-control feedback
maintain quality and brand alignment of teachers. If given bad rating learning specialists will contact the student and try to set up a meeting. They will jot down concerns and meet the teacher. Give students the sensation of being well taken care of. 

4. Teacher Selection
teachers can be chosen from a menu of possible teachers. Professional Photographer. Well manicured page showing interests, some videos of them talking and being themselves. Etc. A group of High quality and well-presented teachers is pivotal to overall success.(more ideas: Star teacher program. Later on teachers pay into the program. Even further: Scholarship program, students who want to one day become teachers can defer their payments until they become teachers.)

5. value-perception through design.
How many schools have an app? I bet it sucks. It probably looks hokey and will only run on a windows 95 phone in ie 6. Make ours look and feel cutting-edge.
Interaction with the app will help generate visual and attitude associations

C. Learning-Centric
6. journaling 
7. note-taking
8. data aggregation
9. personalized homework delivery through app
10. progress visualization

D. Sales-Support
11. open sales-channel with existing and previous customers
12. retention through gamification
13. lead generation
    “hey check out this cool app I use with my English school” 
14. Free, non-member, version of App so potential leads can learn about the company through the app.

My family has always valued the conversation. Funny, how much we love to chat, and I've never really stopped to think about how much importance we plaec on the conversation, between us. In big cities like Sao Paulo, Brazil , and on the internet talk has become cheap. For me and my family, talk is what we live for. My dad always told me how important it is to meet eye to eye to talk sincerely about something important. Having a conversation is the best investment you can make. The return is infinite! 

And i's beautiful.
