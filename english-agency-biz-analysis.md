 English Agency
Business-Analysis



PROBLEM SET #1
(STUDENT)

A. Brazilians need English skills for their job,
but Brazilians don't speak English 

Benefits for a Brazilian fluent in English
1. 30-50% increase in salary*
   *(this factor is consistent even at the mid and upper executive level)
2. fluent English speakers are shortlisted for new opportunities*
   *( for many jobs experience and university degree have been cited as less important)
3. social status
4. opportunities abroad

One of the rebuttals for the high price of the English agency's service is comparing the cost / benefit of a attending a top-school master's degree program. 

The Crux: English Schools rarely help students reach fluency

English opens doors for Brazilians,
but for most, that door is not only locked,
but the door they think will lead them to English fluency
is a dud.

It's not enough to put in the time, you have to do it the right way.
Many who dedicate time and money to studying English find themselves ill-prepared, even after many years. 

Why?
1. Public and private schools alike are ill prepared.
2. Almost everyone is mis-informed about ideal the structure for the language learning process.
3. The Brazilian culture is generally undisciplined and not study-oriented.
4. Class quality is improperly measured by emotional value and status-associations
5. Over-importance placed on grades, degrees, seals, and proof. (confusion between proof of knowledge and possession of it)

The English Schools scheme:

# of English Schools: 
At least 15 major schools (franchises), with hundreds if not thousands of units each. There are also hundreds if not thousands of small schools and agencies. 
Size of Market: 5 million+ in Sao Paulo  
enrollment numbers: unknown
graduation rates: unknown
test scores of school graduates: unknown

Structural problems in the English School Business Model
misplaced incentives
franchise wants to sell books
schools want to fill classrooms
hiring criteria prioritizes status-appearance, presence, and entertainment value over English
fluency, or teaching ability
obsolete method
retention without content (dark patterns)
poor pay cannot attract or retain talent

Problem/Solution Set:

Problem: Poor Teacher Quality
Solution:
Attract better teachers with better value proposition
rigorous selection criteria
carefully planned training, motivation, and retention strategies

Problem: Suboptimal learning curve
Solution:
Employ method with fluency as the goal
Smaller classes (made possible through certain expenditure cuts
quality teachers
 
Our Solution:
Attract, select, train, motivate, and retain high quality teachers; use a method that is effective, but is flexible and easily modified for further improvements; Employ a business model that incentivizes us to guarantee hiring of good teachers, the use of practices that ensure their productivity, and to continually improve our teaching method, thereby helping students quickly reach fluency.


PROBLEM SET 2

(FOREIGN-TEACHERS)

Benefits of Teaching English in Sao Paulo as a Foreigner:
Foreigners are high-status
(can walk into the offices and spaces of high-society and be welcomed)
Networking – foot in the door with the crème de la crème 
No experience needed
No degree needed
Pays well (7USD – 50USD per hour)
Lifestyle – flexible hours, lots of free time
Stimulating work 
No boss

Okay, so It's not that good.

Downsides:
Volatile Income (students quit without warning)
Few people or institutoins pay on time
Although the hours are flexible, most teachers work more than they would like to make up for the volatiltiy
If class is private or business, commute time between classes is usually 45-90 minutes
No transportation, food, or restaurant stipends. No health insurance. No retirement. 
Schools provide stable income and better hours, but charge a huge spread.
Foreign teachers have very limited paths to becoming fully recognized citizens.
Little incentive to improve skills  (no growth or promotion options)

Solutions: 
Volatile income (students quit without warning)
Solution: Provide sales support to provide continuous volume of students

Few people or institutions pay on time
Solution: Pay teachers on time, regardless of if or when students pay

Although the hours are flexible, most teachers work more than they would like to make up for the volatility
Solution: provide bonuses, advances, and other sources of income, to supplement slow periods

If private, commute time between classes is usually 45-90 minutes
Possible Solution: allow free or low-cost rental of company e-bikes, bicycles, or moto-boy

No transportation, food, or restaurant stipends. No health insurance. No retirement.
Possible Solution: provide stipends and benefits usually provided by other types of employment.

Schools provide stable income and better hours, but charge a huge spread
Solution: reduce spread, charge more, or add value by improving working conditions
Types of Services:
gym membership, company wireless plan, sales and teacher support offices

Foreign teachers have very limited paths to becoming fully recognized citizens.
Aside from marrying, investning lots of money to start a business, spending lots of money to forge having a pre-existing business, having a child, or waiting a decade to receive amnesty.
The english agency has a long-term partnership with a legal and accounting firm to regularize foreign teachers before entry. Through this process the foreign teachers are elgible to work, open a bank account, start a business, and enter and leave as they please. This is a huge advantage for almost all foreign teachers.

Little incentive to improve skills
no growth or promotion options
exceptional teachers are selected to be part of the 'inner circle' where further benefits are accrued, including stock-option and profit sharing, trips, access to exclusive services, and are shortlisted for administrative jobs. In exchange they participate in strategic planning and branding committees and action groups, aside from their teaching activities. We also provide them with personal marketing specialists to help them improve their “personal brand” and “brand experience.” Should the pool of teachers grow exponentially, these teachers will be the mentors that help disseminate best-practices and branding approaches to future and current teachers.  

Conclusion: 
Benefits / Selling Points for Teachers:
1. A Bridge to Brazil
	Help teachers regularize (documents, bank account, etc)
	We offer concierge services to help people adapt
	We get them up and running with a decent income
2. Foot in the Door
	Ambitious and growth-oriented teachers will have opportunities to realize those ambitions
	Teachers accrue professional connections and business opportunities
	Opportunities to apply skills for horizontal and/or vertical growth
	Personal marketing and personal brand development services 
3.  Attractive working conditions
	We pay better than anyone else
	The company structure is flat
	Mechanisms for reducing pay volatility and augmenting employee income



Structure

Stimulating small businesses, favoring growth of individuals and the success of human-sized organizations over monstrous growth of a single organization through monopoly. Each of the brands mentioned above is a franchise, that is easily replicable and operates like a cooperative, called an 'outfit,' which
 reap all of the benefits of having a large company behind them (legal structure, accounting, branding, refined adminstrative processes) without all of the overhead and rigidity of process. 

The system is structured so that outfits can self-manage and make deliberate modifications to the brand model that they have chosen to work with, including but not limited to price and client engagement strategies. This flexibility is healthy if changes are deliberate and well-recorded, as changes that lead to optimization can be replicated across the entire network of franchises.

Their performance is incentivized inside of the system according to a retention score, a credit score (according to how timely their students pay and/or how often their students forego their future commitments to pay), and an engagement score (attendance, app usage, etc.). We also use job placement rates and fluency progress scores. These scores, as well as student activity information collected through regular operations, are used by our banking arm to help us decide which student/outfit or student/teacher/outfit combinations are most likely to result in student engagement, student payment, and, of course, student success. 

Our banking organization takes these future payments, securitizes them, and sells them to an FIDC. We do this to replicate the student-loan model in the United States. This allows us to charge more for our services under the expectation that, in achieving English fluency through our service, the student will be able to get a job with a higher paying salary (see appendix for study on this). This is achieved by deferring a percentage of the monthly payment amount to the future and paying our teachers up front through the sale of those deferred payments to investors in an FIDC structure. 

Ex: Cost is X per month.
Student pays Y today
After student gets a better job he/she pays (X*T-Y*T) with interest 
Things to be decided: the exact pricing model for this

The requirements for teacher participation or outfit operaitons are that the cooperative subject itself to certain internal controls and auditing (customer satisfication and class-progress auditing). Each of the cooperatives has a membership limit. As the limit is being reached the outfit is prompted to begin discussing if and how it will react. Will it divide itself into a number of smaller outfits, will a few from the old outfit jump ship and start a new outfit? Such decisions are not made inside of a vacuum inside of the network, and teachers should be considered more than just teachers in these circumstances, with their behaviors as organizers, managers, and idealogical contributions being considered in the event choosing who will participate in larger, more corporate-esque functions. 




Branding

[insert image here]

As you can see from appendix 1. The structure of the company attends multiple niches, or pseudo-niches. There is a central core where 95% of the administrative, managerial, and strategic operations take place. Each of the brands targets a time-specific instance of what is a fluid and volatile target market (see section titled “Market Assumptions” to learn more). Members of this market are known to switch English approaches a lot, and it has been decided that this is due largely to constantly shifting priorities. The goal of The English Agency is to properly align as many of these priorities as possible into a variety of packages, to retain students. If a particular student starts to shift his or her priorities, then the company will have an offering (brand) that better fits their new priorities. 

When intend on using data-analysis techniques to continually improve our understanding of our student's priorities, and to predict how, when, and why his or her priorities are shifting.

For all brands or offerings, we will be drawing from the same pool of teachers, the core pedagogical principles change very little. Activities, approaches, and behaviors may change, but the teaching method remains the same.  One can liken the marketing model to an engineering and real-estate development company that builds a variety of housing types, but the principles of construction and the pool of workers doesn't vary according to who will be housed in the structure.

Brands:

Viva 
Tagline: Aulas para seres humanos (classes for human beings)
Appeal: Appeal to Cultural Exchange and Human Interaction

Problem: It feels good to socialize, and in todays digitally saturated world, young adults are getting so very little of it. 
Description: You learn something when you think it's important to you. If something has an impact, good or bad, your brain will probably do a better job at registering that information. The brain lights up when we engage in learning something to which we have attached a deep sense of importance. 

Our brains and our bodies like it when we are on the path of learning something new. That also happens when we are on the path to making a new friend. Learning something new and making a new friend don't need to be mutually exclusive. In fact many friendships are based on situations of mutual learning and discovery. Why not bring that to the English class? Likewise, learning a language is a deeply cultural experience. Many even argue that language is culture, and the culture is encoded into the language. Therefore, in order to experience either of the two any substantial way they cannot be mutually exclusive.

Classes are geared toward people that like to have interesting and engaging conversations. They may not be getting that in their lives (most of my student are not). They really like the idea of sitting down and having a one hour chat, twice a week,  about Game of Thrones, trading life stories, and talking about their job, home life, or the world.

Who are the students: These students are usually intermediate or above, are from middle class families or above, have attended a conventional english school (usually as a child or adolescent) and need to improve their listening and speech-production.

What these students want: 
friendship
light-hearted, charismatic, and emotionally available company
A class that is about them, their life, and their needs

What they look for in a teacher: 
Someone that won't spend too much time bringing up their own life problems, but is always available to be a shoulder to cry on, if needed. 
Someone that is well cultured, well-groomed, professional, and well-mannered. 
Someone with teaching experience as a private english teacher. 
Someone with more than a passing notion of their segment of the business world and how it operates. 

What these students don't want: 
Boring and prefabricated lessons. 
Excessive amounts of reading and writing. 
Mainstream English books. 
Grammar lessons. 
Smelly stinky teachers. 
Blabbermouths. 
People who aren't punctual or consistently enthusiastic. 

Voice
Appeal: Learn to be expressive, persuasive, poetic. Come to speak the language as well as a native in a particular domain (usually sales or being a project advocate).
Problem: A marketing director needs to sell a social media campaign to the executives at Disney for their new Star Wars movie (yes, Disney owns the Star Wars franchise). Being persuasive and holding attention requires an intricate familiarity with the language, or, at least, with respect to the domain of whatever it is one needs to talk about. 
Description: Activities and practices are focused on the acquisition of highly polished english in a particular domain. The activities are often project-centric, based on simulating presentations and calls, writing documents, developing arguments and 'spiels.' There are a number of sub-activites that are conducted that to help students sharpen their skills, such as “let's say that in a different way” and a number of structured exercises for developing ideas and ways of discussing them. 
What students want: 
To be effective communicators
	 to get deals done, sell their projects, and solve problems

What students are looking for in a teacher: A person who has this ability themselves, in the target language. Professional Qualities of BEM and Tailor-Made are a definite plus, but ultimately spontaneity and verbal, intellectual, and rhetorical prowess are more important. 
What they don't want:

Broca
Tagline: conectando pessoas, connectando ideas, conectando voce ao seu futuro
(connecting people, connecting ideas, connecting you and your future)
Appeal: The desire to be excellent. (Alternatively, though this could be spun off: I need to learn english really fast! I need someone who knows what they are doing!) 
Problem: Students are dissatisfied with the results in proffered (what's the word mean again?) by traditional language schools (and maybe with traditional learning institutions). They are looking for an alternaive, or are interested whent they learn one exists. How do people like Einstein and Salavador Dali come to be? 
Description: We are the real deal. The language learners, and we have the fluency to show for it. We have a method that has been is based on our personal experiences learning, in meta-cognition, and in the latest and greatest in learning-science to work so that you can get up and running in no time flat. We look for the exceptional. We look for the exceptional to work with us- the learning 'geniuses.' You don't have to be a genius to join us, but you have to want to become one to stay. There may be a selection criteria (like Harvard and MIT), where we don't let just anyone get in. This may be used in an exclusive, high end service where students are “invited” and “accepted.” Such a service would be expensive, but we would offer scholarships, student loans, and placement service (see silicon valley's programmer Bootcamp courses). 

Hopefully our students will come away having learned more than just a new language, they will have learned how to learn, and will have met others who are dedicated to accomplishing the same thing. This is the appeal for them to stick around. The English classes become a community of learning, of those in pursuit of learning and excellence (hence the part connecting people).  

Student Profile:

Appeal: Exclusivity. You are Special. This is for you, exactly as you want it and need it.
Specialties: A thorough professional report and study plan is drafted and sent shortly after the first sales meeting. The student can get a free consultation and a free report every 6 months (this is valuable information for us). We can follow up with the person's study plan and see what has changed since the last meeting. If the person becomes a member she/he will be provided a personal learning specialist , who will help guide the private classes with his/her teacher.

Specialties: the student always show up in a well-fitting suit or similar status-marking attire.  The student must be professional. That means he must be business-oriented and well-mannered to the brazilian standards.  The classes will most likely

The Structured / Unstructured Learning Dichotomy 

Students need ample time in practicing both structured (formal learning and study) and unstructured (practice and production). There's an ongoing debate about which is more important, and how these priorities should be reflected in the flow a student's language-learning activities.

Marketing in-depth

An exploration of market-specific behavior
Underlying Assumptions
1) The target-market is composed of many niches
2) The composition of these niches is non-deterministic and fluid.
3) In other words, membership of a particular niche can be, and often is, ephemeral and temporary.
4) A student may not even know what his niche is until he has been engaged. 
There is extreme fluidity of membership between the niches of the particular target market, therefore, they are considered pseudo-niches.

OBS1: Each of the members of the target market have multiple, sometimes competing, desires with relation to ESL education. As such, they quit quickly after having signed up (on average 6 months), due to some motivators being aligned with the school, while others not.*  Though they quit very quickly after signing up they wait approximately 8 months before signing up at a different school. *(relevant commentary: We seek to align as many motivators as possible, The brand has an appeal to an identifiable base desire, but we do our best to ensure that all of these appeals exits in all of the products.

OBS 2: Since the niches are actually pseudo-niches, a subset of a well-defined target. Each one of these pseudo-niches being representations of a person's predominant turning-point motivator, the members of one particular niche are often very aware of the others, and they use this information to define themselves, their progress, their status, as well as their current and future needs. Brands are built socially, within a spectrum of use and reaction. It is argued that the impact of these mechanisms are more potent in English schools than for coffee, for instance, and in particular the holographic socio-collective definition and status building effect is even more pronounced in English schools for young working-age adults. 

Considerations: 
The mixture of coaching and english teaching

Marketing Flows

The Meta-Funnel

The English Agency already has a number of easily replicable client interaction models, complete with an identity, offering, method, materials, and training policies. These business models can be adopted by our partners to create an outfit or cooperative, and are tested against our demographic with the common algorithms used in digital marketing (M A/B and variants) to determine under what conditions a particular student will find best product-profile fit. 

If we have multiple upper-level funnels that connect to a central funnel, we expect to have a wider reach with an almost identical product.

If a person is captured at even the highest level of any particular brand funnel, we can re-engage certain, strategic, people with our other brands at strategic moments.

How do we determine these strategies?

Data
At specific intervals (which can be tested to determine), based on when the student is predicted to start shopping around, or when the teacher reports he is losing interest, or when we can see through data that he or she actually is shopping around, we can start to ping that person with offerings from our other brand names. Since we already have an extremely well-detailed profile of our student we can expect to achieve much higher levels of capture-rate than paid ad and remarketing networks. Rather than paying someone else to help us target them, We can save costs and contact them directly and use those cost savings to focus on delivering a solid presentation of our concept, in an attempt to increase conversion.

 We can use in-house talent to tailor our digital offering specifically to the student. Since one student closed with an average lifespan of 6 months brings in between R$3600 to R4800 in total profit, not counting word of mouth referrals, it make sense for us to spend R$400-R$1000 to modify digital content and better address pain points in order to capture strategic students. 


Brand Management Structure

The marketing and branding (T-UX) decisions of the niche brands are managed  through a council as shown the images below.



Perspectives on Market – Product Fit

Market: 
We are an alternative to the english school market.

“I have been to english schools. That's not what I'm looking for?”
Why? 
- “I want privacy.”
- “I want the class to be about me and my needs”
- “Working from a book is dorky and stupid. I can do that from home, on my own.”
- “Most of the teachers aren't qualified.”
-”I know scores of people who have spent 5-10 years studying consistently at english schools, and yet I know of not a single one of them that chalks up their fluency to their experience at the school.”
“I want to learn conversation. Even the best schools give me at most 10-15 minutes of conversation time per class, and even then, it's always with other students, who are at the same fluency level as me.”

Founder's perspective: 
“A number of the students I have attended are very successful in their careers. That success quite often has hinged on their exceptional ability to learn and apply knowledge. Despite what popular belief would lead you to believe, such people who are good at learning in informal contexts, like the workplace, are not 'talented.' Their excellence is does not find it's origin in some sort of innate intellectual superiority, no, their ability to learn is cultural. The brightest of the bunch, that 3%, is a bunch that have reached some unthinkably high peak not due to the winning of a genetic lottery or a gift from god. They owe their excellence to a set of attitudes, beliefs, and character qualities. The approach is acquired, and is due to a collection of self-reinforcing qualities, habits, and intuitive notions, such as:  introspection or self-reflection about their process, perceptive prowess about what and how others are operating, the ability to abstract those observations (about self, other, and context) into general principles or some other modeling technique, then the discipline to apply those observations about their learning process to whatever it is that they are learning. 

Now,  here's the secret: When someone works iteratively, to improve on improving their ability to improve, then, very quickly, patterns of exceptional learning capacity, what we call 'genius,' start to emerge. 

The types of people that have successfully mastered something understand the learning process. When someone who has experience mastering something goes to an English school, they quickly recognize that what is being offered will not conduce them to a place of higher language fluency.

That's when they start looking for people like me.”


Sales

Sales Strategies

Founder's perspective: “My clients have historically looked for me. They are people who, by their own experience, the experience of their peers, or some acquired capacity generalize about the language learning process, have come to the conclusion that the traditional classroom experience as well as the traditional private teacher experience does not suit their needs. These people have historically always come to me, rather than the other way around.

After five minutes of talking with them they've already made up their mind.”

Key: when entering large companies we must use the personal marketing concepts that I have developed to build our cross-referenced, holographic, reputation (of authenticity and professionalism) and use the advocate/partner model to achieve virality inside of said company.

HR

Hiring Practices
Consulting businesses' primary business offering is the labor of highly specialized and talented workers. It is hard for such a business to achieve the types of economy of scale most other types of businesses enjoy. Many consulting company business models have higher costs as they scale. 

Everyone wants to work at a company that pays more, but not everyone has the profile to justify a higher salary. That means talent-intensive companies with ineffective hiring practices will most certainly have very low profitability per employee. Combine that with a management-heavy hierarchical structures, that incentivize micromanagement, and these otherwise talented workers are placed in workplace situations that are almost guaranteed to produce suboptimal.  On the other hand that logic flips if hiring practices are carried out effectively, and if internal motivators and development/compensation tracks are correctly aligned.  How does that look?

Respect the intelligence and capability of your talent-workers. Trust them to do a good job by structuring the company so that they self manage , taking responsibility for the results of the company and compensating them fairly and consistently for their contributions.

The structure of the company is flat, talent-workers have the option, but not the obligation, to contribute to the non-pedagogical operations of the company, as a business professional. 

Teachers have dual roles within the company, 
Pedagogical: they are learning professionals who teach mostly business professionals how to learn English.
Managerial (partner): As employees serving managerial, administrative, and/or strategic functions: Since they are learning professionals, they are expected to learn to apply themselves to also become workers in the 


Partner : structure is flat and fluid. They self-organize into teams according to task. Conception, planning, and execution can originate from any employee.  The model has been employed successfully for over a decade by Valve a well-known software development company.  They have demonstrated how this is an effective business model for companies with a pool of similarly-typed customer-facing employees, who's primary function hinges on their being exceptionally intelligent and/or skilled at knowledge/ability acquisition and transmission. If they can learn to program and design software at the level the company requires, then successfully managing a company is not outside their abilities. So, why not give them the opportunity to apply that learning and productive capacity in novel ways, that can add value to the company and the customer? We apply this same thinking to our English Teachers.

Pedagogical Operations (Teacher) Pay: according to position and teacher auditing
Business Operations (Partner) Pay: stack pay, profit sharing, and peer review

Outside of the pedagogical operations, the company structure is flat. We use the Valve model of peer-review and (maybe) stack pay. Teachers are expected to take ownership of many of the managerial, administrative, and strategic processes. The rate they are to be compensated is determined by stack pay, where other business operations employees rate the value of the employee's work relative to other employees. These employees are expected to present themselves to certain types of students (the ones that want to learn business English) as business operators. 

They are expected to learn as much as possible about the areas for which they have taken ownership, and seek the advice and knowledge of their students when trying to learn and apply it. This adds many benefits: the teacher is learning a valuable career skill, which they can use to get into a field of their choosing or remain in the company. (refer to situated cognition, situated learning and communities of practice).

Since the teacher is probably also an operator (or is at least more aware than a layman) in the student's chosen field, the student and teacher are able to hold authentic conversations about their particular field of study. Last, the company is able to vastly reduce the cost of its business operations, increasing profitability per employee many times over. This is accomplished not only due to cost reductions of having teachers operate in functions that would otherwise be filled by specialists in the area. but also due to the increased cohesion and motivation from employees freely participating in a self-growth oriented company culture. 

We require employees to have a deep interest in some subject. They must work toward understanding that field and, if they want, can apply hobbies, talents, and fields of knowledge and experience are important, as these add texture to the persona of the teacher in his professional field.

Over time, employees will be allowed to work in the business side more than the teaching side, and may begin to take on responsibilities in the business operations aspects that require much of their time. Nonetheless, ALL employees are expected to teach at least one class per week. Here's the justification: 
1. This is a learning organization. 
2. Being a teacher and taking responsibility for someone else's' learning process will help the teachers retain the optimum mindset for constantly learning and applying. 
3. Staying in touch with the culture and demands of the customers. All employees should have direct contact with the end-user, for obvious reasons.
4. Having them all remain teachers is helpful in maintaining cohesion when it comes time to collaborate in business operations, as they all will have the teacher mentality.

Hiring Practices

During the interview explore the candidate's earliest memories of using language, their relationship to learning (when did they start reading, who taught them? Who taught them about poetry? Do they write it? Does their family have a literate, academic, and intellectual background? If not, how did they acquire such a disposition? Ask about their favorite teacher before they were 12, their favorite teacher when they were a pre-teen, an their favorite teacher in high school. Find out why they lked that teacher. Did that teacher awaken something in them? Help them come to understand some important aspect of society or themselves?
They must understand and believe in the transformative power of learning and study.

Valve looks for T shaped personalities, but I don't think we have such restrictions.

We need to develop a culture of continual refinement. We don't have the final answer on what the optimum approaches are to being able to learn and collaborate well. We don't know what the optimum mental techniques and habits are to guaranteeing that context switching is done effectively.

One thing that I do know: after learning the basic and intermedite skills of a subject, becoming an expert requires contact with productive and constructive feedback from other learning professionals.  For example, you can know how to use photoshop, but not understand the principles of design. Professional level refinement of a particular skill can only occur in the 'knowledge is a set of cultural practices.' These cultural practices can be axiomized, but it remains an abstraction (a derivation) of their context of application.  Just like learn in a language, learning how to design, how to lead a sales team, or whatever else. 

We are not restricted to teaching English. The employees can use all resources of the company to pursue new business objectives, as a second order priority, so long as their utilization is not prejudicial to the functioning of the core business.

The relationships formed with students can be used as the basis for new business, but the teacher must not operate outside of the fold. Connecting students to generate new business is also done.

Hiring Criteria
English abilities knowledge and abilities:
Just because someone is a native doesn't mean their English is good enough to teach someone in an international business context. Accents are fine as long as English is their mother tongue, or they have reached native-like levels of fluency.  They need to know how to conduct themselves culturally and linguistically in an international anglo-oriented business context. 

Is the teacher Athletic? 
Athleticism is a sign of hard work. Learning a language is an ability acquisition activity. Skills development, not physicality, is the determinant of athleticism (see chess and the rise of 'cyberatheletes'). Atheletes usually know how to learn something. They are a good example of the discipline necessary to excel at something. There is considerable evidence on the mind-body link, that mental sharpness comes from acute physical exertion (i.e. exercise). Last but not least teaching private English classes in Sao Paulo is extremely strenuous. You will be walking 10+miles per day, in the heat, with business clothes on, then you will have to show up full of energy to teach a class to  people of a culture that care infinitely more about how nice and energetic you are than how good of a teacher you are. 

Hiring Process:
1.Teacher is recruited or sends resume
2. introductory meeting
