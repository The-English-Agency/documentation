 (payroll)(overhead)(taxes)(benefits)

   (profit distribution)

wallets:
one per function or one per function type (predictable variable or by destination)

considerations: 


funds distribution for business expenses programmatic where possible
95% of all withdraws are pre-determined

all withdraws require an authorization between owners

pre-determined withdraws can be programmed for auto-approval(attack surface here)

owner authorization can use the briar protocol to authenticate (guarantee identity)

locks on the % amount of funds allowed to be withdrawn(this is an ethereum best practice: rate-limit)

saftey locks for known threats
saftey locks for erratic behavior (this is an ethereum best practice: circuit-breaker)

authentication process needs to be fleshed out
