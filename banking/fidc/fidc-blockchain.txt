we are going to use the blockchain to manage ownership in FIDCs

we want a secondary market for nglish-class tokens, which can be presold at what is usually the season of low new-sales volume. the fact that they are buying from their cell phone is an advantage during the holiday season, because they are working considerably less, therefore a specific subset of the overall target market will not be on travelling somewhere will cell phone use is looked down upon nor will they be in a highly social environment or an environment with nature (beach may see spikes in usage for specific types of app usage). these questions need to be considered and discussion should be sought with fellow co-workers.
